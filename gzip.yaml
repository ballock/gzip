      Description: |
          Zless  is  a filter which allows examination of compressed or plain text files one
          screenful at a time on a soft-copy terminal.  It is the equivalent of setting the 
          environment variable LESSOPEN to '|gzip -cdfq -- %s', and the environment variable
          LESSMETACHARS to and then running less.  However,  enough people seem to think that
          having the command zless available is important to be worth providing it.
      Requires:
          - /usr/bin/less
